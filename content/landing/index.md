# Hello.

This is a site I made when I took the [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) courses. It may evolve into something more than that.

My main goal this 2021 is to be a really good front-end developer. If this is your goal too, you might find this site useful. If so, consider [buying me a few cups of coffee (or tea) üçµüçµüçµ](https://ko-fi.com/minimithi)!

Bored? Check [this cool thing](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod) I made.
