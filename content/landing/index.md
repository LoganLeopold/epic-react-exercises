# Hello. 👋

You've stumbled upon my interactive notes about [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/). It may evolve into something more.

My main goal this 2021 is to be a really good front-end developer. If this is your goal too, you might find this site useful. Consider [buying me a few cups of coffee (or tea) 🍵🍵🍵](https://ko-fi.com/minimithi)!

Something isn't working as expected? [🐞🐛 Let me know! ](https://github.com/mithi/epic-react-notes)

Bored? Check [this thing](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod) out, I made it and I think it's really cool.
